## Crescendo 2 Demo: Scope of Work ##

This document details functionality requirements for the Crescendo 2 Demo system. The goal is to provide an easy to use interface utilizing the latest Smart Graphics.

The user experience should be consistent across all interfaces.

----------

### System Overview ###

#### "The Loft" ####

**Global:**
(2) iPads and (2) iPhones provide roaming (and external) access for all rooms and system features.

**Media Room:** Powered by a Crestron DM6x4 switcher along with a _Crestron Connected_ A/V receiver.

_Primary Interfaces:_ iPad, TSR-302.

**Kitchen:**
The Kitchen television has access to Media Room sources via the second output of the DM6x4. _(Kitchen video sources will provide audio through the television speakers, audio sources will route through ceiling speakers.)_

HR-150 contains a "Media" button that will synchronize with what is being watched in the Media Room _(if the overhead speakers are on, they should turn off.)_

_Primary Interfaces:_ TSW-750, HR-150.

**Master Bedroom**

The Master Bedroom includes local video with a Tivo Mini (sharing with the Media Room's Genie) and Apple TV. Sound for the video system is provided by a Sonos Playbar _(audio sources are routed to ceiling speakers)._

_Primary Interfaces:_ HR-150, iPhone, iPad.

**Environmental:** the system includes wireless lighting and shade control for the main area and 2 wired thermostats.
